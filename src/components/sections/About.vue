        <p class="mb-3">
            I decided to pursue IT as my college major literally as I was signing the enrollment forms, torn between another course that I also had a passion for. Fast forward to now, I can't say I regret that decision because I absolutely love it!
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            This choice provided me with the opportunity to contribute to and develop software for various industries, including 
            an <a class="hover-link" href="https://iformatlogic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IT Company</a>, 
            a <a class="hover-link" href="https://capex.com.ph/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">logistics company</a>, 
            a <a class="hover-link" href="https://iformatlogic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">distribution company</a>, 
            and a <a class="hover-link" href="https://www.pictureworks.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SaaS company</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
            Currently, my main focus revolves around developing and maintaining software solutions for various clients as a freelancer. 
            Beyond project work, I dedicate myself to continuous learning, immersing in the latest technologies, and delving into 
            Data Structures and Algorithms with the goal of being among the top 1% in the industry

            When I'm not at the computer, I usually play <a class="hover-link" href="https://www.chess.com/member/dthrllnrs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chess</a>, or hang out with my wife and kids.
